## Technologies

Before attempting to execute any _Python_ code in `etf_analyzer.ipynb`, it is imperative that your development environment holds the following modules:

[numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) - Scientific computing module.

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - Data analysis module.

[hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/getting_started/index.html) - High-level plotting API for PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews

[sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - Relational database module.

## Installation Guide

With your _Python 3.7+_ environment, run the following commands via CLI:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
import sqlalchemy
```

## Examples

## Usage

1. Clone repository onto your personal machine. 

2. Open _Jupyter Lab_ or _Jupyter Notebook_ via _Anaconda Navigator_ and navigate to the directory in which the file `etf_analyzer.ipynb` is present. _All relevant code for this repository will be executed via Jupyter Notebook and no output will be printed to the command line_. Ensure that all relevant dependencies and _Python_ modules are installed (see __Technologies__ and __Installation Guide__ for more details) before attempting to execute code within _Jupyter Notebook_; otherwise, you will receive multiple interpreter errors! 

3. With the notebook open, start at the very first cell reading "Import the required libraries and dependencies" (a cell will be active when a rectangular border is surrounding the area in question). Run each cell in sequential order. _It is vital that all cells are ran in sequential order or your notebook will generate compiler errors_!.
